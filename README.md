# Streamlit_Sales_Dashboard

First we need to setup the Conda environment. After setting the Conda, we can move forward to environment creation
1) Create Environment with below command 

conda create -n stenv python=3.9

Where we are guiding conda to create environment with the name of "stenv" that uses Python 3.9 version

2) Next we activate the environment

conda activate stenv


3) After activating the environment we run the streamlit installation command which is :
pip install streamlit

4) once the Streamlit is installed we can run the above python file to visulize the data:

streamlit run <python filename>
